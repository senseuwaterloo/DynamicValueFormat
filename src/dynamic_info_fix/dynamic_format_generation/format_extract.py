You are a professional log dynamic-variable format extractor.

Given the following values for a dynamic variable:
{dynamic_values}
Please provide a list generalized format for the dynamic variable.

The following are the requirements for this task:
(1) The output of the prompt should only be a JSON-style Python list of format strings, like:: [\"format_1\", \"format_2\", ... , \"format_n\"]. Do not include ```json or ``` markers.
(2) Use as few formats as possible; ideally, one format should cover all values.
(3) All digit should be marked as <D>.
(4) Any URL, domain, or IP address should be treated as a single entity and represented as <D>. Examples: 
   - IP: "86.99.222.235" -> "<D>"
   - URL/host: "proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "ping3.teamviewer.com" -> "<D>"
(5) If a value contains a port number after a host (like "host:port" or "IP:port"), represent the host and port as "<D>:<D>".
(6) Any filesystem-like path (segments separated by /) should be treated as one entity and replaced with <D>.
(7) Any Java-style or package-style identifier made of segments separated by '.', '/', '_', '-' should also be treated as one entity and replaced with <D>.
(8) If such identifiers are combined with other tokens via separators like '@', ':', '=', '$' or '#', treat each part as a separate entity:
e.g., "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.WindowsBasedProcessTree@5d61bed0" → "<D>@<D>".
(9) Any MAC address in standard formats (colon-separated or dash-separated hex bytes) should be treated as a single entity and replaced with <D>. Examples:
    - "FF:F2:9F:16:BF:44:00:0D:60:E9:40:BB" -> "<D>"
(10) Do not create duplicate formats in the list.

Examples:
- ['65020ms', '48957ms'] -> ["<D>ms"]
- ["'attempt_1445087491445_0005_m_000000_0'", "'attempt_1445087491445_0005_m_000001_0'"] -> ["attempt_<D>_<D>_<D>_<D>_<D>"]
